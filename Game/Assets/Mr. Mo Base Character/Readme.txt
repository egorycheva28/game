How to:
1. The models are mecanim ready.
   Drag a prefab from Prefab folder into scene.
   
2. Import any mecanim animations from the Unity Asset Store (plenty of free ones!).
   Or simply use animations inside the standard assets provided by Unity.

3. Create new Animator Controller.
   Set it up by dragging animations into it and add scripts if necessary.

4. Apply the Animator Controller onto the prefab you just dragged into the scene.

5. ...

6. Profit?
